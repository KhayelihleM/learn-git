# Git Learning Repo

This repository documents my hands-on learning experience from the **FreeCodeCamp YouTube course**:  
ðŸŽ¥ [Learn Git â€“ Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)

## ðŸ“š Course Highlights

The course covered foundational Git concepts, including:

- âœ… Initializing a Git repository (`git init`)
- âœ… Tracking file changes (`git add`, `git commit`)
- âœ… Viewing commit history (`git log`, `git diff`)
- âœ… Branching and merging (`git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`)
- âœ… Resolving merge conflicts
- âœ… Working with remote repositories (`git remote`, `git push`, `git pull`)
- âœ… Cloning repositories (`git clone`)
- âœ… Undoing changes (`git reset`, `git revert`)
- âœ… Ignoring files with `.gitignore`
- âœ… Tagging releases
- âœ… Using GitHub for remote collaboration

## ðŸ§  My Learnings

- I now understand how Git tracks file changes over time.
- I can confidently stage, commit, and revert changes in a local repo.
- I practiced branching workflows and resolving merge conflicts.
- I learned how to push and pull changes from GitHub.
- I realized the importance of commit messages and version control in team environments.

## ðŸ“‚ Note

This repository focuses on **Git operations and commands**, not the functionality of the files themselves. It serves as a personal Git practice ground.
